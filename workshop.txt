description=[h3] Common Issues and their fixes [/h3]
description=1. "My server won't start" "Normal Termination" etc etc
description=[url=https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/42925-how-to-fix-updated-mods-in-build-41-multiplayer/] [b] FIX - Update your copy of AuthenticZ, sometimes Steam doesn't do it correctly. Review Method 2 on updating mods for servers/local servers  [/b][/url]
description=
description=2.  "I can't upgrade my backpack or use the attachment slots" etc etc
description=[b] FIX - Make sure you are NOT running multiple branches of AuthenticZ, this is a common issue of doing that. Make sure you have the sufficient materials to upgrade. Secondary bags (small bags that you can not wear on your back) need a carabiner (can be crafted with 5 paperclips) so it can be attached to the "Secondary Bag Slot". [/b]
