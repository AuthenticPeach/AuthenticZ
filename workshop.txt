description=[img]https://i.imgur.com/5E15TyB.png[/img]

description=[h3] Common Q&As [/h3]
description=
description=[b]Q: Is Authentic Z compatible with the the newest Build 41 Patch? (41.78)[/b]
description=A: Authentic Z is fully compatible with the 41.78 update! No Build 40. Build 41 only.
description=
description=[b]Q: Is Authentic Z compatible with [X] mod? [/b]
description=A: Possibly. Ask about it in the comment section below.
description=
description=[b]Q:Does this add zombies? There are too many of them![/b]
description=A: This mod does not spawn zombies. It spawns certain outfits on zombies at different rates.
description=
description=[b]Q: Does this add special-ability zombie types? Like in TerrorZed, Soul Filcher's Turning Time, or Weird Helis? [/b]
description=A: Not currently. Maybe in the future.
description=
description=[b]Q: What do I do with the AuthenticZBackpacks+ module? [/b]
description=A: This branch is for the people who only want the backpack system that AuthenticZ offers. Do NOT enable this with the regular Authentic Z branch - It will create redundancies.
description=
description=[b]Q: I do not like [X] module. Can you make another branch to separate it out? [/b]
description=A: I have already made 3 different branches to cater to your preference. At this point of time, I do not wish to make more branches since it requires a lot of work and headspace to manage it all and keep it all up to date.
description=
description=[b]Q: I found [X] bug or error. Can you fix this? [/b]
description=A: Sure! My goal is to have the mod as compatible as possible with any mod whenever possible. Please state what error you found and if you have any other mods that may have caused the conflict.
description=
description=[b]Q: Does this work with Multiplayer???? [/b]
description=A: Yes. This mod has been extensively tested in MP across many servers.
description=
description=[b]Q: Can this mod be implemented to a live server or do I need to completely make a new world for it? [/b]
description=A: The mod will partially work on an ongoing save. Some things will work, other things will not. It's best to start a new save with it to get all of the features.
description=
description=[b]Q: When joining a modded server, I get the error "File doesn't match the one on the server" How to fix?? [/b]
description=[url=https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/42925-how-to-fix-updated-mods-in-build-41-multiplayer/]
description=A: I wrote up a guide on this, give it a read and try out the methods. [/url]
description=
description=[h3] Common Issues and their fixes [/h3]
description=1. "My server won't start" "Normal Termination" etc etc
description=[url=https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/42925-how-to-fix-updated-mods-in-build-41-multiplayer/] [b] FIX - Update your copy of AuthenticZ, sometimes Steam doesn't do it correctly. Review Method 2 on updating mods for servers/local servers  [/b][/url]
description=
description=2.  "I can't upgrade my backpack or use the attachment slots" etc etc
description=[b] FIX - Make sure you are NOT running multiple branches of AuthenticZ, this is a common issue of doing that. Make sure you have the sufficient materials to upgrade. Secondary bags (small bags that you can not wear on your back) need a carabiner (can be crafted with 5 paperclips) so it can be attached to the "Secondary Bag Slot". [/b]

description=I do not give you permission to use the AuthenticZ assets for anything outside of gameplay functionality, unless specially given by me. My assets are considered Steam workshop items and can not be used to create NFTs. NFTs violate Steam TOS. Please do not re-upload my mod without my specific permission. I have the means and motivation to go after such violators.
