description=Remember - This mod does not spawn zombies on the map - it follows the zombie spawn intensity map (See Map above). It instead adds zombie outfits and new clothing.
description=
description=Works on all old saves. Rezones do happen on cells you already loaded in and visited, HOWEVER - it does not affect the zombies that already spawned (Due to persistent zombie spawns). When zombies respawn, then they fall under the new rules set by this mod.
