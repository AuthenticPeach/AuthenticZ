title=Authentic Z
description=The Best and most Realistic zombie distribution mod.
description=
description=This mod adds a variety of zones into the game which gives zombies outfits to match their surroundings.
description=It also adds over 60 custom zombies which are appropriately placed in the world.
description=
description=The point of this mod is to add the zombie outfits that the Indie Stone developers made, but never put into vanilla gameplay - by adding in appropriate setting and rarity.
description=
description=Here are some of the main features of Authentic Z.
description=
description=- The Crossroads Mall spawn random zombies.
description=- The March Ridge Dormitory is rezoned to have unique zombie placement within it.
description=- Ice Cream workers at each Ice Cream shop.
description=- Dedicated spawns for Hazmat zombie, Service Uniform zombie, and Ghillie Suit zombie at the Secret Base
description=- The large campgrounds, southwest from Riverside, are rezoned into Friday the 13th's Camp Crystal Lake. Find Jason, before he finds you! (Soon to have other Slashers!)
description=- Student and Varsity zombies at schools have been fixed to only have realistic hairstyles.
description=- Fisherman and Poncho zombies alongside lakes and rivers (If zombies spawn there)
description=- Hunter Zombies chance at isolated cabins and hunting stands.
description=- Zombified Heroes from all your favorite zombie media
description=- Famous Zombies from the zombie genre
description=- Clown zombies…...Yes…...Clown Zombies.
description=
description=-and a nice hit-list with checkboxes so you can log your progress! Great for late-game content!
description=
description=AND MUCH MUCH MORE! See dedicated discussion for full list of features.
description=
description=Remember - This mod does not spawn zombies on the map - it follows the zombie spawn intensity map (See Map above). It instead adds zombie outfits and new clothing.
description=
description=Works on all old saves. Rezones do happen on cells you already loaded in and visited, HOWEVER - it does not affect the zombies that already spawned (Due to persistent zombie spawns). When zombies respawn, then they fall under the new rules set by this mod.
